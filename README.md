<h2>Welcome to Dai-PI!</h2> 
<p>Pronounced Day-P.I.</p>
<p>Yes, I know it isn't how you're SUPPOSED to spell it.</p>
<p>These are specific items built for the Liminal Nightmares major pack! You are welcome to use the items in here,</p>
<p>but I seriously doubt anything in here will fit what you're looking for.</p>
<p>Very WIP! Expect Dev to be slow. I don't actually really know how to code!</p> 

<h1>NOTICE: THE USE OF AI ON ANY ASSETS OR CODE IS STRICTLY PROHIBITED. I DO NOT SUPPORT THE USAGE OF GENERATIVE AI ON ANY PROJECT. AS A RESULT, I HAVE A MODIFIED NO-AI-MIT LICENSE ATTACHED, AS WELL AS ATTCHED AN AI-RESTRICTION LICENSE.</h1>

<h2>About Dai</h2>
